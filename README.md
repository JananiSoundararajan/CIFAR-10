## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using PyTorch for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model definition, training loop with loss/accuracy tracking, model evaluation, and performance graphs.

## Key Features
* üìä Data preprocessing and augmentation
* üìà Model definition and training
* üìä Model evaluation and performance metrics
* üìà Confusion matrix heatmap generation
* üìä Accuracy and loss tracking

## Technology Stack
Backend: PyTorch

ML: PyTorch, Scikit-learn

Libs: NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JananiSoundararajan/CIFAR-10.git`
2. Install required libraries: `pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Run the project: `python CNN_(1).ipynb`

## Usage
The project can be used to train and evaluate a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model can be trained using the `CNN_(1).ipynb` file, and the performance can be evaluated using the confusion matrix heatmap and accuracy/loss plots.

## Configuration
No specific configuration is required for this project.
